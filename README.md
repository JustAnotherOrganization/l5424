# l5424

[![GoDoc][docs_badge]][docs]

---

l5424 is a collection of RFC5424 compliant logging interfaces and loggers.

The point of this repo is to show several possible ways of implementing RFC5424 compliant loggers.

---

The Go Language is extremely fragmented in how it addresses logging. The goal of this project is to
try to start discussion regarding some form of standardized logging in Go.

If you're reading this you are encouraged to play with the interfaces and loggers as well as read
the RFC5424 standard and discuss in issues your thoughts on logging standards.
